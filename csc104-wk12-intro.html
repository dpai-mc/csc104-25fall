            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600">Aloha, and welcome to <strong>Week 12</strong>! This week we begin our exploration of <strong>PowerPoint</strong>, Microsoft's presentation software. We'll focus on the fundamentals: creating and editing presentations, working with themes, adding and organizing slides, incorporating images, and understanding the PowerPoint interface. PowerPoint tends to be more intuitive than Excel, as many of the formatting concepts carry over from Word. The key is learning how to organize information visually on slides and navigate PowerPoint's unique layout tools.</p>

00:00.560 --> 00:08.380
Aloha and welcome. So we are on week 12. It's our first week of PowerPoint and I just wanted to

00:08.380 --> 00:16.060
quickly go over the rest of the semester. So this is this week the 17th through the 23rd. Next week

00:16.060 --> 00:23.400
week 13 is Thanksgiving week so we have some time off so it's really just a short week

00:23.400 --> 00:29.480
but we'll still have something to do and then I need to look at the last two weeks

00:30.000 --> 00:34.580
because I do want to do this inserting word art charts and tables as part of PowerPoint

00:34.580 --> 00:43.240
and then I need to do email and calendar and outlook. So probably during sometime next week

00:43.240 --> 00:48.040
I'll publish all of this stuff. I have it pretty much all laid out. I just need to go through a

00:48.040 --> 00:52.860
couple things and then I need to create new videos for each one. Other than that though

00:52.860 --> 00:56.320
we're looking like we're pretty much close to the end of the semester.

00:59.480 --> 00:59.980
PowerPoint

00:59.980 --> 01:04.700
we're starting PowerPoint so PowerPoint is a

01:04.700 --> 01:14.360
it's a presentation software okay and so that's what this first part is is just creating and

01:14.360 --> 01:22.580
editing presentations with pictures and themes and changing fonts and titles and different

01:22.580 --> 01:29.000
slide layouts and adding slides moving them around in your presentation and that kind of stuff.

01:29.980 --> 01:37.580
Okay um it should for the most part a lot of the stuff will be the same as in Excel and in Word like

01:37.580 --> 01:43.260
themes and colors and all that kind of stuff. There's a difference now in that it's displaying

01:43.260 --> 01:50.440
information in a slightly different way and the organization of your page is slightly different.

01:50.440 --> 01:54.000
So that's the primary difference. People tend to find PowerPoint easier to do when what they're really just editing for them to do do than thinking through the way PowerPoint works.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.360
They apply something to their page you know. so how do I do this in glitzy and compartir information?

01:55.360 --> 01:59.960
We're going to do this here but one thing that's important isSněuneve 숨к revelations

01:59.980 --> 02:05.920
or Excel. Excel tends to be the most difficult for people and PowerPoint

02:05.920 --> 02:10.180
tends to be the easiest. So hopefully that'll make sure everything goes

02:10.180 --> 02:16.600
smoothly for everyone for the rest of the semester. So the other thing I didn't

02:16.600 --> 02:19.160
really was wasn't gonna go through all these different things because they're

02:19.160 --> 02:25.000
all the basic stuff of how you add a slide, change a slide, move a slide, add a

02:25.000 --> 02:29.800
picture, move a picture around, change the size of the picture, you know that kind

02:29.800 --> 02:41.620
of thing. Okay so but what I did want to do quickly is so if we look at well for

02:41.620 --> 02:47.680
me this was the original. This is this week's project that you have to do. It

02:47.680 --> 02:52.000
opens up. This is what it looks like when you open it and then so you have all

02:52.000 --> 02:59.380
your slides on the left. This is then called the normal view and in your in

02:59.380 --> 02:59.780
your book.

02:59.780 --> 03:04.460
It'll talk about all these things. Okay it's seven slides in this in this

03:04.460 --> 03:11.020
presentation because everything's a presentation. So there's seven slides and

03:11.020 --> 03:16.500
like it's just called normal view. You have all the slides on the left. The

03:16.500 --> 03:20.560
center is where you're working on which slides you're currently on. It should be

03:20.560 --> 03:25.220
highlighted. It's hard to tell but there's a little like red rim around the

03:25.220 --> 03:29.360
number one slide here. And then there's notes and so I

03:29.360 --> 03:35.060
can change this and it says the file specifically created for and should

03:35.060 --> 03:40.720
have your name in it. I don't know if everybody gets identical slide sets. But

03:40.720 --> 03:47.400
anyway this is the one I got. So this is the PowerPoint. Then we have the

03:47.400 --> 03:54.800
instructions. Okay you know and it talks about hey this is the first thing so

03:54.800 --> 03:59.080
just like all the routes, change the name to number two. Do these things, change the theme to all.

03:59.360 --> 04:05.000
orange resize the picture change this to bold okay on each slide it talks about

04:05.000 --> 04:21.140
doing these things okay so the only one I really wanted to say this one six it

04:21.140 --> 04:27.740
says select all the text in the placeholder and this is on slide five so

04:27.740 --> 04:38.100
when I go to PowerPoint I go to slide five now this is not slide five at that

04:38.100 --> 04:41.540
point this is slide five when you get to this point this will be slide five

04:41.540 --> 04:46.840
because you'll have to add it in a new slide so I think it's this is slide five

04:46.840 --> 04:51.440
but when it says the placeholder what it's actually talking about is this

04:51.440 --> 04:57.080
block of text here okay so there's two sides this is the title

04:57.740 --> 05:03.080
then this is the content and it's talking about this text making the

05:03.080 --> 05:13.640
changes to this text okay okay so it's saying change it to orange accent one

05:13.640 --> 05:23.660
darker 25 you do that the same way as you did in word okay go in here and I

05:23.660 --> 05:27.740
think this is a wrong theme to have orange

05:27.740 --> 05:37.340
that's gold here's orange this is accent four i think it's supposed to be accent two

05:37.340 --> 05:42.880
darker 25 but anyway because earlier you need to change the theme

05:42.880 --> 05:52.800
okay and themes are a little bit different in design so you have themes on the left

05:52.800 --> 06:01.720
and variants on the right okay variants are like change the color scheme and you can pick

06:01.720 --> 06:09.620
any of these different color schemes okay themes are the basic the slide layouts where's the title

06:09.620 --> 06:16.100
where's all this other stuff and there's many different pre-built themes in here you know wood

06:16.100 --> 06:22.580
type if you put your mouse over my hold up for a little bit i'll tell you what they are you want

06:22.580 --> 06:22.780
to do

06:22.800 --> 06:30.100
office use this one facet okay and so there's a bunch of different slide types

06:30.100 --> 06:35.660
or themes that you can use and it'll change where the title is and things like that change the color

06:35.660 --> 06:40.700
schemes and stuff all right so anyway though that's the only thing i really wanted to say

06:40.700 --> 06:45.260
because i found that i thought that might be a little confusing when it says select all the

06:45.260 --> 06:52.500
text in the placeholder what it meant was in the basic text on the in the text box for the

06:52.500 --> 06:52.580
slide

06:52.580 --> 06:58.740
slide itself so all your bullets and stuff like that okay and then when you're done with it

07:01.780 --> 07:07.540
you should look something like this because it asks you to show it in this view

07:09.380 --> 07:13.700
mine looks slightly different than the one in the

07:16.820 --> 07:21.220
instructions the difference was in the instructions this text this is the new

07:22.580 --> 07:28.580
text why it matters okay this text here mine is kind of like a dark blue

07:30.100 --> 07:35.780
and if we look at the instructions and you scroll down to the bottom of the instructions

07:35.780 --> 07:39.380
there's this kind of bright blue i don't know why that is

07:41.940 --> 07:47.380
i picked the same color scheme it should have worked out identical but came out slightly

07:47.380 --> 07:52.340
different but when they submitted it for grade i didn't i got 100 so it didn't matter

07:52.580 --> 08:01.060
okay so just all the steps if you do the steps might look slightly different everything else

08:01.060 --> 08:06.420
looked identical except for that for me that was the only one that looked different but

08:06.420 --> 08:11.540
when i scored it it scored the same so for whatever reason

08:13.860 --> 08:18.900
all right and so that's it for this week in terms of powerpoint is to just do this

08:18.900 --> 08:20.100
um

08:20.100 --> 08:22.100
um

08:22.580 --> 08:27.060
i guess the only other thing i'll say is when you if you download your grade report

08:30.340 --> 08:30.660
from

08:34.180 --> 08:36.100
the thing you download your grade report

08:37.700 --> 08:42.100
um there's an extra slide it adds a new slide the last slide is your grade report

08:42.900 --> 08:46.100
so it's what you got did you do this did you do this did you do all this stuff

08:47.380 --> 08:50.100
okay that's where you'll get your grade

08:53.380 --> 08:58.100
all right so that's the powerpoint let's get started with powerpoint

08:59.300 --> 09:05.220
again if you have any questions the best thing to do is to go to the syllabus and find my

09:06.820 --> 09:12.180
calendar link and create a you know create a meeting with me especially if you're having

09:12.180 --> 09:18.660
some problems uploading downloading something's not working right that tends to be the easiest way

09:19.620 --> 09:22.340
sometimes i'm able to troubleshoot people if they

09:22.340 --> 09:28.660
send me enough information but it's always easier if i can see what's going on typically

09:28.660 --> 09:32.820
most of the issues that i've found or had students have had have been things like i

09:32.820 --> 09:39.300
just showed you misinterpretations of what is being asked of you that's the biggest one

09:40.820 --> 09:44.740
and usually i can spot them fairly quick if that's something simple like that if it's a

09:45.860 --> 09:52.100
some internal technical issue then that can take a lot longer but we tend not to really have those

09:52.100 --> 10:00.820
very often so all right well good luck have fun and talk to you soon`;
