                    <p data-start="0.56" tabindex="0"><span class="timestamp">00:00</span> Aloha, welcome to week three of our 15-week course, our 14 and a half week course.</p>
                    <p data-start="7.02" tabindex="0"><span class="timestamp">00:07</span> This week, we're working solely in Word in the module two for creating a research paper.</p>
                    <p data-start="14.54" tabindex="0"><span class="timestamp">00:14</span> All right, I don't really have a ton I want to talk about other than to say that there is a lot in this chapter or in this section about how to use Word to do certain things.</p>
                    <p data-start="25.9" tabindex="0"><span class="timestamp">00:25</span> All right, and so the textbook, sorry, I should, I was playing around and I, here we are, creating a research paper, okay.</p>
                    <p data-start="41.34" tabindex="0"><span class="timestamp">00:41</span> This does MLA. I could have done APA, but I decided let's just leave it as MLA since most people, I know all English teachers MLA, so that's what you get from English, so let's keep it there.</p>
                    <p data-start="54.54" tabindex="0"><span class="timestamp">00:54</span> If you do APA, if you're in the social sciences, you do APA, so it's slightly different, but you know, the setups are pretty much the same within Word.</p>
                    <p data-start="69.66" tabindex="0"><span class="timestamp">01:09</span> Okay, so you go through, there's a lot of stuff, changing document settings, right, start Word, styles, modify style, and then creating headers.</p>
                    <p data-start="83.24" tabindex="0"><span class="timestamp">01:23</span> Okay, how to format stuff.</p>
                    <p data-start="86.46" tabindex="0"><span class="timestamp">01:26</span> How to display the ruler, first line index, autocorrect as you type, okay, all this kind of stuff, citations, how to do those.</p>
                    <p data-start="95.94" tabindex="0"><span class="timestamp">01:35</span> All right, so there's a lot of stuff in here in how to insert a page break, and all this is important.</p>
                    <p data-start="99.42" tabindex="0"><span class="timestamp">01:39</span> I find it super important because, well, you can do a lot of these things without using these formatting tricks within Word by just by using, you know, superscripts, subscript, putting in extra carriage returns to go to a new page, and stuff like that.</p>
                    <p data-start="122.94" tabindex="0"><span class="timestamp">02:02</span> The problem with doing all that is often when you have to edit something, it breaks the formatting everywhere.</p>
                    <p data-start="129.88" tabindex="0"><span class="timestamp">02:09</span> So you want to use the formatting tools within Word, okay, to actually make it, in the long run, make it much easier to maintain and edit, and proof, and do all that kind of stuff.</p>
                    <p data-start="144.54" tabindex="0"><span class="timestamp">02:24</span> I know that we don't, use that as much anymore because we're not all paper-based.</p>
                    <p data-start="150.08" tabindex="0"><span class="timestamp">02:30</span> A lot of times we're publishing online, but still want to, if we use all these tools and publish them online, it'll look better online as well.</p>
                    <p data-start="159.28" tabindex="0"><span class="timestamp">02:39</span> So the thing is really long, there's lots of stuff.</p>
                    <p data-start="163.94" tabindex="0"><span class="timestamp">02:43</span> I find that I find reading doesn't really help me absorb the information.</p>
                    <p data-start="169.78" tabindex="0"><span class="timestamp">02:49</span> And so that's why we have, I have these optional things I could practice. Okay.</p>
                    <p data-start="176.42" tabindex="0"><span class="timestamp">02:56</span> They don't count in your grade. I call it practice, but these are practice tasks and to do to practice all this stuff that's in Word for creating a research paper.</p>
                    <p data-start="190.28" tabindex="0"><span class="timestamp">03:10</span> Okay. And this is not about how do you write a research paper, you know, how to develop a thesis.</p>
                    <p data-start="195.28" tabindex="0"><span class="timestamp">03:15</span> That's not this, that's not this class.</p>
                    <p data-start="197.28" tabindex="0"><span class="timestamp">03:17</span> This class doesn't teach you or go over, you know, format the, how do you write a paper?</p>
                    <p data-start="205.18" tabindex="0"><span class="timestamp">03:25</span> It goes over. How do you format and create a properly formatted paper in Word doesn't tell you, you know, you gotta do your hypothesis and your thesis and all your questions and review the literature.</p>
                    <p data-start="221.3" tabindex="0"><span class="timestamp">03:41</span> That's not what this course is. It's not a research course.</p>
                    <p data-start="224.06" tabindex="0"><span class="timestamp">03:44</span> It's how to use Word course at least part, how to use Word. All right.</p>
                    <p data-start="227.7" tabindex="0"><span class="timestamp">03:47</span> And so these three things, you don't have to do them if you don't want to do them.</p>
                    <p data-start="233.56" tabindex="0"><span class="timestamp">03:53</span> If you feel like, you know, Word and you can read it, you understand it.</p>
                    <p data-start="237.16" tabindex="0"><span class="timestamp">03:57</span> Great. Um, you only have to do this project assignment. All right.</p>
                    <p data-start="244.18" tabindex="0"><span class="timestamp">04:04</span> So you have to do this project, one B word module, create an assignment.</p>
                    <p data-start="252.46" tabindex="0"><span class="timestamp">04:12</span> If you haven't done these, I think you've done these already, but just to make sure that you understand how to do them.</p>
                    <p data-start="260.62" tabindex="0"><span class="timestamp">04:20</span> The first thing you want to do. Okay.</p>
                    <p data-start="264.48" tabindex="0"><span class="timestamp">04:24</span> You check all these things, you have the correct version office. You just start, right start.</p>
                    <p data-start="270.42" tabindex="0"><span class="timestamp">04:30</span> And then the first thing you really need to do, you need these, you need to start file.</p>
                    <p data-start="275.3" tabindex="0"><span class="timestamp">04:35</span> Look at the name of that file. It's got my name in it. It's specific to me, um, instructions, or you can just do download all. Okay.</p>
                    <p data-start="286.28" tabindex="0"><span class="timestamp">04:46</span> And you can download the instructions and this starting file. You open this file.</p>
                    <p data-start="290.58" tabindex="0"><span class="timestamp">04:50</span> And then you grab the instructions and you knew the things in this file that it says, to do okay and then once you do first thing is going to be to rename it I think to underscore to okay dot docx okay and then what you can do is every time you finish you can upload it so you never have to worry about where is it and you can grab it and download it next time you come back and then edit it and then put it back up there or</p>
                    <p data-start="325.88" tabindex="0"><span class="timestamp">05:25</span> you can just do it all locally and when you're done just drag your final version up okay and once you've loaded it okay you can drag or click your browse once you've loaded it then you can decide do I want to submit that or if I'm not really ready I can download it edit it and put it back in okay and once you're done then you upload to Sam and it's going to give unlimited submission so it'll submit for a grade</p>
                    <p data-start="351.28" tabindex="0"><span class="timestamp">05:51</span> don't like your grade you can do it again do it again okay and that's all there is to this assignment I didn't download the instructions I don't know exactly what they say but I'm assuming they're gonna be very similar to implementing all of those features or a majority of those features that you go over in the reading and in the practice all right and if I were to practice</p>
                    <p data-start="381.08" tabindex="0"><span class="timestamp">06:21</span> let me go back to modules I were to practice you look at these practice this is a project well there's a practice project so probably would like to do that</p>
                    <p data-start="395.92" tabindex="0"><span class="timestamp">06:35</span> the training is how to do each one each of those things in the reading okay walk through each thing in the reading so that's the training and that's probably where you want to start especially if you're unsure about how to use Word or any other English language you can go back to when you're done and then of these features okay you want to start with the training and then you might want to do the end of project model project as a example so you understand what this project is really asking for</p>
                    <p data-start="425.14" tabindex="0"><span class="timestamp">07:05</span> the other thing you'll notice this time is that these three do no longer have any points associated with them and you do not appear in assignments because they're not part of the grade okay</p>
                    <p data-start="433.46" tabindex="0"><span class="timestamp">07:13</span> previously i uploaded them incorrectly and so they would see they said assignments are due on a date and they used to say 100 points now they say zero points because they don't count towards your grade okay</p>
                    <p data-start="446.9" tabindex="0"><span class="timestamp">07:26</span> so i figured out how to upload them so that they only show up as practice and they're not a submission or assignment submission to you</p>
                    <p data-start="463.22" tabindex="0"><span class="timestamp">07:43</span> you're just for you to apply the things that are in the reading so you get some hands-on practice before you actually have to do the assignment okay and that's really all i really wanted to say about this week if you have any issues let me know good luck and we'll talk to you again next week</p>
