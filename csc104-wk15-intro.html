00:00.740 --> 00:06.940
Aloha. So week 15, the last week of the semester, and we're going to power through Outlook,

00:07.420 --> 00:15.320
email and calendars. Okay, so what you're going to do for this week, obviously you're going to read

00:15.320 --> 00:20.480
email and Outlook, and then there's one practice for each, and then there's one assignment for

00:20.480 --> 00:27.520
each. Now the email assignment is the required assignment, and you can do the calendar assignment

00:27.520 --> 00:33.680
for some extra credit points, about half an assignment's worth. So let's take a quick look

00:33.680 --> 00:41.700
at the email assignments, how that works. Okay, because it's a little bit different,

00:41.700 --> 00:45.460
and it's the same for the calendar. It works a little bit different than

00:45.460 --> 00:50.960
it did, it does for the other things, because other things are project-based.

00:51.440 --> 00:57.440
Now the email and the calendar assignment in Cengage is,

00:57.520 --> 01:07.580
because you can't really set it up as an assignment that way, what it does is

01:07.580 --> 01:15.280
you have to do things, like this is the email, so you have a bunch of questions,

01:15.280 --> 01:23.700
you have three attempts, it can take a little while to get through these. It's like it says

01:23.700 --> 01:27.500
I'm on task four, because I'm on task four, and I'm on task four, and I'm on task four,

01:27.520 --> 01:34.180
because I did one, two, and three. Oh, this is what I missed, didn't do, so you can see I did some of these.

01:34.180 --> 01:39.460
Here let's jump to this one, check spelling. And so basically what I'm asking you to do,

01:39.460 --> 01:46.820
check the spelling of the first flag word, maintenance. Okay, correct the spelling.

01:46.820 --> 01:51.460
Check spelling in a second, and then ignore all instances of that spelling.

01:51.460 --> 01:55.280
So you're gonna go to maintenance, and oops,

01:57.520 --> 02:03.580
telling change it piece them in I'm going to ignore all because that's what it said to do

02:03.580 --> 02:07.460
okay and it says answer correct and then it'll move to the next one

02:07.460 --> 02:14.720
okay so every single question you get it comes up and it says it

02:14.720 --> 02:20.880
you get another one and it looks like you have three attempts but it looks like you when you

02:20.880 --> 02:26.700
come back in because I played with it once and I skipped create a signature so I didn't do it

02:26.700 --> 02:32.540
and now it says I only have two attempts remaining even though I didn't do it before

02:32.540 --> 02:39.440
all right I think I tried it and I couldn't find it I can never find signatures when I try to do

02:39.440 --> 02:48.500
them but anyway and this looks a little bit different than my outlook okay but it works

02:48.500 --> 02:54.220
similar to same as outlook this is my outlook this is my full outlook how I choose to look at

02:54.220 --> 02:54.820
my outlook

02:54.820 --> 02:56.100
um

02:56.100 --> 02:56.680
um

02:56.680 --> 02:56.700
um

02:57.420 --> 03:00.660
okay so here's we'll pick something like this one

03:00.660 --> 03:05.220
and mine is set up so that it doesn't download all the pictures automatically

03:05.220 --> 03:07.520
this kind of stuff okay

03:07.520 --> 03:11.480
and so it's very similar

03:11.480 --> 03:18.180
um outlook's very similar in the real outlook

03:18.180 --> 03:24.640
I'm using classic outlook there is a new outlook I turn it off because I don't like it

03:24.640 --> 03:26.420
um

03:26.700 --> 03:30.760
this might be more real new outlook but anyway

03:30.760 --> 03:36.220
okay your emails appear you click on it your reading pane is on the right

03:36.220 --> 03:39.420
you can change that and move in get rid of it and do all that kind of stuff

03:39.420 --> 03:48.240
okay so just so you know it's very similar to the outlook client that people use like I use daily

03:48.240 --> 03:54.000
and all my computers and even on my phone sometimes

03:54.000 --> 03:56.680
um I have to use it because I have to use it on my phone sometimes

03:56.680 --> 04:01.240
it's hard to use my college email

04:03.160 --> 04:06.680
because it's unlike your college email your college email is a

04:07.560 --> 04:11.640
google email so yours is a gmail mine is a microsoft email

04:12.520 --> 04:20.520
so it's hard to use microsoft 365 efficiently without using the college I mean without using

04:21.080 --> 04:26.440
microsoft stuff and outlook works and the calendar works together they get integrated

04:26.680 --> 04:34.980
and whether you know this or not outlook and google don't mesh well

04:34.980 --> 04:41.660
okay and so if you're using this normally you'll have this is your email and you'll have your

04:41.660 --> 04:49.100
calendar here and this will be your calendar on your outlook calendar so when you do the calendaring

04:49.100 --> 04:54.760
you'll you'll have this view but it's all the same as it's in the same application it's in outlook

04:54.760 --> 04:55.120
okay

04:55.120 --> 04:55.160
okay

04:55.160 --> 04:55.660
okay

04:55.660 --> 04:55.680
okay

04:55.680 --> 04:55.700
okay

04:55.700 --> 04:55.720
okay

04:55.720 --> 04:55.740
okay

04:55.740 --> 04:55.760
okay

04:55.760 --> 04:55.800
okay

04:55.800 --> 04:55.820
okay

04:55.820 --> 04:55.860
okay

04:55.860 --> 04:55.920
okay

04:55.920 --> 04:56.080
okay

04:56.080 --> 04:56.100
okay

04:56.100 --> 04:56.140
okay

04:56.140 --> 04:56.160
okay

04:56.160 --> 04:56.320
okay

04:56.320 --> 04:56.640
okay

04:56.640 --> 04:56.660
okay

04:56.680 --> 05:04.980
so like I said the biggest thing here on this outlook assignment is you're now task of 26 or

05:04.980 --> 05:11.620
whatever and you just go through them and it looks like you can come back and it'll save where you're

05:11.620 --> 05:19.140
at and when you're done you click submit and it'll give you a score okay you can look go what's my

05:19.140 --> 05:25.140
score going to be oh there's one wrong you don't have all these I haven't done yet that's a file

05:25.140 --> 05:26.660
that's the important thing you can do is you can go and you can go and you can go and you can go and

05:26.660 --> 05:28.680
and you can go and you can go and you can go and you can go I just forward an email line copy email

05:28.680 --> 05:29.380
swing by what I say,

05:29.380 --> 05:30.100
recipients, create a folder close comes down

05:30.100 --> 05:30.500
recipients, create a folder close comes down

05:30.500 --> 05:31.840
recipients, create a folder close comes down

05:31.840 --> 05:32.420
all right

05:32.420 --> 05:32.980
all right

05:32.980 --> 05:33.480
listings name

05:33.480 --> 05:34.280
listings name

05:34.280 --> 05:34.840
listings name

05:34.840 --> 05:35.200
structure

05:35.200 --> 05:36.000
If you're on a Mac,

05:36.000 --> 05:36.660
system,

05:36.660 --> 05:37.300
case,

05:37.300 --> 05:40.920
shortcut keys,

05:40.920 --> 05:45.760
this is the required assignment.

05:45.760 --> 05:46.200
Chips,

05:46.200 --> 05:46.620
instructionciller,

05:46.620 --> 05:47.260
OK,

05:47.260 --> 05:47.760
understand

05:47.760 --> 05:49.000
so this is the required assignment

05:49.000 --> 05:49.400
OK

05:49.400 --> 05:49.560
OK,

05:49.560 --> 05:51.160
I'm just going to close mine,

05:51.160 --> 05:55.500
no care please

05:55.500 --> 05:56.600
and then the

05:56.600 --> 06:11.840
extra credit assignment is the calendar version but it's exactly the same format

06:11.840 --> 06:18.720
okay it's going to I'm open up a new window and then it's gonna have a bunch

06:18.720 --> 06:32.040
of tasks to do and you need to walk through them just like you did for email

06:32.040 --> 06:39.240
but here it says it's only 15 tasks there's one of 15 okay change the status

06:39.240 --> 06:46.340
of the new workshop leaders orientation appointment to tentative right

06:48.720 --> 06:58.480
show as tentative answers correct and then it's gonna automatically move to

06:58.480 --> 07:08.160
the next task okay so you're gonna have to work through this and then when

07:08.160 --> 07:13.200
you're all done again you click Submit and you can do this title you can jump

07:13.200 --> 07:18.120
around if you really want to okay and then you click Submit

07:18.720 --> 07:24.480
get your final score okay and again said this is extra credit if you want to

07:24.480 --> 07:29.700
do it for an extra potential 50 points I think we have 15 weeks so we have

07:29.700 --> 07:39.600
somewhere around 16 or 17 hundred points in this class so you know if you're

07:39.600 --> 07:47.840
close it'll help you if you're not close it's not gonna do a lot anyway so treat

07:47.840 --> 07:48.480
it that way and

07:48.720 --> 07:55.820
good luck and it's been great having you this semester and hopefully this

07:55.820 --> 08:04.060
everything worked out for you have a great winter break Merry Christmas and

08:04.060 --> 08:10.900
maybe we'll see you in the new year thanks bye
