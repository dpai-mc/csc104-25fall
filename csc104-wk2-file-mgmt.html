                        <p><span class="font-semibold text-gray-600">[00:00]</span> Aloha. So I just really wanted to talk a little bit about this week, which is file management in Word 1, or Word the first part.</p>
                        <p><span class="font-semibold text-gray-600">[00:09]</span> So what I did is I wanted to give you some information here on why do we want to use file management.</p>
                        <p><span class="font-semibold text-gray-600">[00:20]</span> Okay, and so for me, it's important. It's an important concept.</p>
                        <p><span class="font-semibold text-gray-600">[00:24]</span> And that it's a way to just keep track of everything you have, everything you do, and how to find stuff easily.</p>
                        <p><span class="font-semibold text-gray-600">[00:31]</span> You can search, but after a while, when you search, sometimes it becomes, well, I search and I get a bunch of stuff, and I really don't want a bunch of stuff.</p>
                        <p><span class="font-semibold text-gray-600">[00:42]</span> Okay, so it's just good practice to organize your stuff, all your files and your digital stuff, in a logical way to make it easy to find stuff.</p>
                        <p><span class="font-semibold text-gray-600">[00:53]</span> Okay. And so. So some best practices, use a clear folder structure.</p>
                        <p><span class="font-semibold text-gray-600">[00:57]</span> So have a structure, whatever it is.</p>
                        <p><span class="font-semibold text-gray-600">[01:01]</span> You use a naming convention.</p>
                        <p><span class="font-semibold text-gray-600">[01:04]</span> One of the things here that we're suggesting here is if you include dates in your name, a lot of times you might want to include the date in your name.</p>
                        <p><span class="font-semibold text-gray-600">[01:12]</span> It's different than, say, the last modified date.</p>
                        <p><span class="font-semibold text-gray-600">[01:17]</span> This is a date that's important about this file.</p>
                        <p><span class="font-semibold text-gray-600">[01:19]</span> Maybe it's the day you started it. Maybe it's the day you completed. Maybe it's the day you submitted.</p>
                        <p><span class="font-semibold text-gray-600">[01:24]</span> Okay, but it's a important date. So you put it in the file name.</p>
                        <p><span class="font-semibold text-gray-600">[01:31]</span> Now, the one thing about when you use dates in file names, you always need to use, the first thing you always need to use, two-digit months and two-digit days.</p>
                        <p><span class="font-semibold text-gray-600">[01:42]</span> Okay, and the reason is, is that in a file name, it's not a number, it's a character.</p>
                        <p><span class="font-semibold text-gray-600">[01:49]</span> Okay, so if you use one, you use month, like January. If you use one instead of 01, and two for February and three for March, what happens when you look at all your files, you get a bunch with dates in them, then the, it'll go one will come first, and then 10, which is October, will come second, and then 11, which is November, will come third, then December, 12 will come before, because those all start with the number one, which is actually kind of a letter one.</p>
                        <p><span class="font-semibold text-gray-600">[02:23]</span> Which is, comes before the letter two, which is February.</p>
                        <p><span class="font-semibold text-gray-600">[02:26]</span> So it'll go January, October, November, December, February.</p>
                        <p><span class="font-semibold text-gray-600">[02:31]</span> Use 01, 02, then the zeros would come before, and everything will be in the proper order.</p>
                        <p><span class="font-semibold text-gray-600">[02:37]</span> The same with days.</p>
                        <p><span class="font-semibold text-gray-600">[02:39]</span> Okay. You know, it would go one, two, three, and then it would do day 30, if there's 30 days in that month.</p>
                        <p><span class="font-semibold text-gray-600">[02:47]</span> Day 31, if there's 31 days in that month.</p>
                        <p><span class="font-semibold text-gray-600">[02:50]</span> And then it would go day four.</p>
                        <p><span class="font-semibold text-gray-600">[02:52]</span> So day 31. Day 30 comes before day four.</p>
                        <p><span class="font-semibold text-gray-600">[02:56]</span> Okay. So if you use two-digit days, 03, 04, 03 will come way before 3, 0.</p>
                        <p><span class="font-semibold text-gray-600">[03:04]</span> All right. And then you, you do the year first, and the reason you do the year first is so that all the same year stuff goes together.</p>
                        <p><span class="font-semibold text-gray-600">[03:11]</span> You do it month, month, like mm-dd-yyyy month, day, year.</p>
                        <p><span class="font-semibold text-gray-600">[03:18]</span> Then all the Januaries would be together, no matter what year they were done.</p>
                        <p><span class="font-semibold text-gray-600">[03:21]</span> And then all the Februaries will be together. No matter what year they were done. No matter what year they were created.</p>
                        <p><span class="font-semibold text-gray-600">[03:26]</span> So typically you do year, month, day, and two-digit month, two-digit years, just to get them to order properly.</p>
                        <p><span class="font-semibold text-gray-600">[03:34]</span> Okay. Don't clutter your desktop.</p>
                        <p><span class="font-semibold text-gray-600">[03:37]</span> You know, I use my desktop, and I try to keep it clean.</p>
                        <p><span class="font-semibold text-gray-600">[03:40]</span> Once I get about 20 things on there, I can't find anything anymore.</p>
                        <p><span class="font-semibold text-gray-600">[03:44]</span> Some people I've seen have their whole desktop cluttered with icons for files or programs, and I don't know. Not anybody can find anything, but some people can, so that's fine.</p>
                        <p><span class="font-semibold text-gray-600">[03:57]</span> Archive old stuff. You want to keep it? Great.</p>
                        <p><span class="font-semibold text-gray-600">[04:01]</span> Just put it somewhere where it's not part of your main folder stuff. Stuff, you know, you don't have to see it all the time.</p>
                        <p><span class="font-semibold text-gray-600">[04:09]</span> So specific stuff, Windows.</p>
                        <p><span class="font-semibold text-gray-600">[04:11]</span> Okay. These are some specific stuff for Windows, and then some specific stuff for Mac OS Finder.</p>
                        <p><span class="font-semibold text-gray-600">[04:20]</span> Now, in R, in this section, what we have here, and I'm going to explain this to you.</p>
                        <p><span class="font-semibold text-gray-600">[04:33]</span> So I posted a link if you're having Cengage issues, you might want to check out this, register your MindTap for Canvas.</p>
                        <p><span class="font-semibold text-gray-600">[04:42]</span> But basically, I've split this section into file management, and then there's a dash line and Word.</p>
                        <p><span class="font-semibold text-gray-600">[04:48]</span> Okay. So the file management is first.</p>
                        <p><span class="font-semibold text-gray-600">[04:50]</span> The dash line says Word. And do the Word stuff after, okay?</p>
                        <p><span class="font-semibold text-gray-600">[04:55]</span> So file management. I've set it up as two parts. Windows or Mac.</p>
                        <p><span class="font-semibold text-gray-600">[04:59]</span> So if you have any confusion on Mac, do the Mac one. If you're using Windows, do the Windows stuff. That's fine.</p>
                        <p><span class="font-semibold text-gray-600">[05:04]</span> Use the Linux, you know. We're using Mac and windows is what we're covering mostly. Okay?</p>
                        <p><span class="font-semibold text-gray-600">[05:13]</span> So you have this Read study. Basically, read this module on files and folder management.</p>
                        <p><span class="font-semibold text-gray-600">[05:21]</span> Which will open up in here. a another window on the Cengage once you link to your accounts okay and so folder management this PC window now you really don't have to do everything search once you get into like 3-1m and I'll link up post this but you don't have to go past three point one m three-dash 100 that you can go past it or read it all that's fine but really you'll have to go to 3.1m because the rest is more about other things other than file management I really more in purpose on file management and folders and properties</p>
                        <p><span class="font-semibold text-gray-600">[06:14]</span> okay and if you are on the Cengage Facebook page and you want to get into something you can go to the Cengage Facebook page and I'll link you who is under a a mac well let me say windows first so the read study this is the content practice these are some typically these are activities you can do onset gauge they do not count towards your grade but they're in there so you can practice and feel comfortable about what you're doing</p>
                        <p><span class="font-semibold text-gray-600">[06:36]</span> on the mac has a section the latest is os monterey which is not the latest but that's what they have and again it's basically walks you through the finder if you're new to mac or haven't used it a lot you might not understand finder very well and um okay and i have a bunch of stuff running app using spotlight doc quitting an app um and i really only care about finder okay so really one point 1-3 is all you really need to do because we're talking about file folders in finder</p>
                        <p><span class="font-semibold text-gray-600">[07:19]</span> okay managing files and folders so you really only need to read 1-3</p>
                        <p><span class="font-semibold text-gray-600">[07:27]</span> okay the rest is good information especially if you're new to mac or haven't used it a lot it's good information that you can find once you're inside gauge just so you know you can always click this x and it should take you to everything not everything is assigned and you won't see it exactly the same way because i'm in the middle of the screen so i'm just going to go ahead and the management side but you should be able to see the whole book in every every section of the whole book all right so i will update those 3.1 3-1 m for windows um 1-3 for mac that's all you really need to read in these modules and then the assignment is really um since there aren't specific mac assignments so i'm going to go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and will help demonstrated how to use your 3.1 and i just made up a simple assignment where all you're going to do is create a couple folders</p>
                        <p><span class="font-semibold text-gray-600">[08:19]</span> and kind of build a couple folders for your file management structure and then take a screenshot and submit the screenshot that shows that your folder structure that you created</p>
                        <p><span class="font-semibold text-gray-600">[08:32]</span> okay and i put in here if you're using windows use the steaming tool</p>
                        <p><span class="font-semibold text-gray-600">[08:37]</span> it's built into windows and if you're in a mac i would use shift command 4 not shift command 3</p>
                        <p><span class="font-semibold text-gray-600">[08:43]</span> shift command 3 will might be out of the way itself i wouldn't be able to count the numbers it takes a screenshot of the full screen and i'd rather use shift command 4 and focus in on the finder itself so that i can actually see it when it blows up i can actually read it and read what you have so shift command 4 on a mac all right and then word word whether you're a mac or pc doesn't matter okay read the module practice these are online practice things that you can do</p>
                        <p><span class="font-semibold text-gray-600">[09:17]</span> your assignment is to do this project 1a so maybe looking at this sample project one that doesn't count would be a good thing you can always do the training and stuff but maybe doing this module project one is a good stepping stone to actually doing the assignment</p>
                        <p><span class="font-semibold text-gray-600">[09:38]</span> okay and you do the assignment</p>
                        <p><span class="font-semibold text-gray-600">[09:41]</span> last week staff had a bunch of stuff about how to use sam and working with sam so hopefully you read through that and went through that</p>
                        <p><span class="font-semibold text-gray-600">[09:51]</span> but if you have problems let me know or issues all right so that's what we have on tap for this week</p>
                        <p><span class="font-semibold text-gray-600">[09:59]</span> file management and the first section of word all right that's all i really want to say about this week and</p>

                <p class="mb-4">In a digital world, we create and download files constantly. Without a system, your computer can quickly become a digital junk drawer. Good file management is the practice of organizing your digital files in a way that makes them easy to find and use.</p>

                        <p>Create broad categories first (e.g., 'Work', 'Personal', 'Photos'), then create more specific subfolders inside. Think of it like a physical filing cabinet.</p>

                        <p>A good naming convention is your best friend. A common format is `YYYY-MM-DD_Project-Name_Version.ext`. For example: `2023-10-27_Marketing-Report_V2.docx`.</p>

                        <li><strong>Quick Access:</strong> Pin your most-used folders and see recent files at the top of the list.</li>
                        <li><strong>Libraries:</strong> Group folders from different locations into one 'Library'. For example, your 'Pictures' library can show photos from your C: drive and an external hard drive all in one place.</li>
                        <li><strong>Ribbon Interface:</strong> The top ribbon provides quick access to common commands like copy, paste, rename, and create a new folder.</li>
                        <li><strong>File Details and Preview Panes:</strong> View details about a file (like date created) or even preview its contents without opening it.</li>

                        <li><strong>Smart Folders:</strong> Create folders that automatically gather files based on criteria you set. For example, a Smart Folder could show you all PDF documents you've opened in the last week.</li>
                        <li><strong>Quick Look:</strong> Press the spacebar on any selected file to get a full-size preview without launching an application.</li>
