            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600">Aloha, and welcome to <strong>Week 14</strong>—our second to last week and final week focused on PowerPoint! This week, we're exploring <strong>inserting WordArt, data, and charts</strong> to add visual interest and convey information effectively. You'll learn how to insert and format WordArt for stylized text effects, work with charts to visualize data, and import content from other presentations. These skills will help you create more dynamic and data-driven presentations. By the end of this week, you'll be able to incorporate sophisticated visual elements that elevate your PowerPoint presentations to a professional level.</p>

00:00.280 --> 00:06.500
Aloha. This is week 14, our second to last week, and it's our last week on PowerPoint.

00:06.820 --> 00:10.720
And PowerPoint is about inserting word art, charts, and tables.

00:12.100 --> 00:16.180
Okay, so it's still the standard format for every week.

00:16.520 --> 00:20.940
There's the reading of the book. There's some practice exercises if you want to use them.

00:21.120 --> 00:23.080
And then there's the actual assignment.

00:24.540 --> 00:27.560
Again, so when you do these, obviously you need to download everything.

00:27.560 --> 00:32.420
And, you know, you get the file, you get the instructions.

00:36.800 --> 00:40.420
So let's quickly go through those.

00:40.940 --> 00:46.500
A couple of times I've gotten these where it doesn't load, but I've been able to hit reload and it comes up.

00:46.860 --> 00:51.180
So I think I've once I had to hit it twice, but everything else just once.

00:53.000 --> 00:56.240
Okay, so you're going to start your thing and I've already done it once.

00:56.240 --> 00:57.540
You can see I've already done it once.

00:57.720 --> 01:00.380
But you'll download everything.

01:01.100 --> 01:05.900
You have two files here you need and a Word document and your PowerPoint.

01:06.800 --> 01:17.480
And then you will go in here and I'm just going to open the Word document instructions right now.

01:18.120 --> 01:19.880
I just want to walk through them a little bit.

01:19.900 --> 01:26.960
There's nothing here that that I know of that really

01:26.960 --> 01:27.440
impacts the PowerPoint.

01:28.160 --> 01:32.480
Or is difficult to understand in terms of how to do stuff.

01:33.760 --> 01:37.960
All right, so you can have this presentation.

01:37.960 --> 01:39.520
You're going to start with this presentation.

01:40.020 --> 01:43.140
You're going to have two support files.

01:43.440 --> 01:45.340
One is going to be a JPEG file.

01:45.340 --> 01:48.260
So it's an image file and one is going to be another PowerPoint file.

01:48.860 --> 01:56.800
And what you're going to do as you go through this, you're going to use some slides from the other PowerPoint and install them into your PowerPoint.

01:57.560 --> 01:59.560
Okay, so.

01:59.560 --> 02:01.560
You know.

02:01.560 --> 02:07.560
Import the picture, sharpen it, you know, set the size kind of stuff.

02:07.560 --> 02:09.560
You know, position it.

02:09.560 --> 02:11.560
Here's where you're going to put it.

02:11.560 --> 02:13.560
Okay, so it's all about.

02:13.560 --> 02:15.560
Images.

02:15.560 --> 02:17.560
Changing them to word art.

02:17.560 --> 02:19.560
Changing text to word art.

02:19.560 --> 02:21.560
So how do you change text to word art?

02:21.560 --> 02:23.560
How do you apply special effects?

02:23.560 --> 02:25.560
How do you change text to text?

02:25.560 --> 02:26.760
How do you change text to text?

02:26.760 --> 02:27.760
How do you change text to text?

02:27.760 --> 02:29.760
How do you change text to text?

02:29.760 --> 02:31.640
How do you add a chart?

02:33.040 --> 02:34.040
Okay.

02:34.040 --> 02:37.920
You have a chart and then you want to basically add this data to the chart.

02:37.920 --> 02:39.920
So you can insert a chart and then you modify the data to be this data.

02:43.920 --> 02:46.920
Here's the chart.

02:46.920 --> 02:49.640
That you'll end up adding.

02:49.640 --> 02:51.640
You're going to take these slides.

02:51.640 --> 02:55.640
Stick them in from this other presentation.

02:56.760 --> 03:03.180
okay and do some other stuff with word art and charts and it's basically when

03:03.180 --> 03:09.060
you're done you're gonna have this just Sam capital margin profit explanation

03:09.060 --> 03:18.240
with some word art your graph and then you'll have these like three or four

03:18.240 --> 03:22.420
inserted charts from the other slide presentation where you also have to do

03:22.420 --> 03:30.160
some modifications you'll do this funky word art thing here okay and then

03:30.160 --> 03:34.180
you'll move some slides around and you'll end up with this presentation of

03:34.180 --> 03:40.180
nine slides all right so um I guess I really didn't want to say too much this

03:40.180 --> 03:48.160
week just follow along go through the steps you're unsure make sure you read

03:48.160 --> 03:52.360
at least read the sections so you know what's in

03:52.360 --> 03:52.380
there and don't forget to hit grow to start thank you for watching and I'll see you soon.

03:52.420 --> 03:56.380
there and you know that you can do it you can pull that up in parallel

03:56.380 --> 04:04.640
depending upon how much real estate you have on your computer you know I would

04:04.640 --> 04:14.860
probably in addition to having the word document I might have this pulled up in

04:14.860 --> 04:22.960
another window okay so this will be like the project window and then I might have

04:22.960 --> 04:32.500
the text up in this other window so that I can go oh let's see replace sample data

04:32.500 --> 04:39.740
how do I do that I could jump to replace sample data right and it'll tell me how

04:39.740 --> 04:44.200
to replace sample data and then I can do that you know especially if I forgot

04:44.200 --> 04:44.600
okay

04:44.860 --> 04:51.400
how to do it all right so that's all I had for this week we need to finish this

04:51.400 --> 04:56.260
up and then next week we're gonna do outlook so which is email and scheduling

04:56.260 --> 05:03.040
and so that will also be posted thanks and it's been great having your class

05:03.040 --> 05:09.100
and they just power through just the two weeks left
