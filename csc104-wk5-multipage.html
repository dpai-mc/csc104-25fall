                Welcome to Week 5! This week, we'll be covering how to work with multipage documents in Microsoft Word. These concepts are crucial for creating structured and complex documents like reports and academic papers. Before you begin the learning modules, please watch the introductory video below. The transcript will highlight the text in sync with the video.

00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:06,880
Aloha and welcome to week five and this is word multi-page document is the title

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:11,580
but really what we're going to be doing or learning this week is

3
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:20,800
a lot to do with kind of things that you would use for papers proposals you know that kind of

4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,520
thing like a research paper proposal for instance you know creating a cover page how do you create

5
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:33,440
a cover page okay using the formatting tools of word so that if you decide to change the title

6
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:38,640
or add something new you know the formatting doesn't get messed up

7
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:49,120
modifying page formatting specific pages deleting page breaks heading styles you can

8
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:55,280
format pages differently in word you can create sections and have one section be

9
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:55,500
multi-page and you can create sections and have one section be multi-page and you can

10
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,880
write column another section be single column things like that so there's a lot of things like

11
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:09,200
that that go into a multi-page document like a report maybe you have headers and footers

12
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,920
and the left page in the right hand side page because you bind your papers that way

13
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,840
are different you know so they show up like the page number shows up towards the outside

14
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,320
rather than the inside or rather than always on the right side of the page so that

15
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,320
you know like a book the left side of the book you want it on the

16
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:35,120
outside probably in the right side of a book you want it on the right things like that okay let's

17
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:39,760
go all that kind of stuff formatting list tables a lot on tables how to play with tables how to

18
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:47,440
mess with tables you know merging cells entering text in cells splitting cells

19
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:54,240
moving boundaries resize tables i don't even know i don't know if they have it in this part

20
00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:02,720
but you can do math in your table okay insert a formula in a table like add the rows to get

21
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:06,880
add everything in a row or add everything in a column things like that in word tables so

22
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,800
you go through that and then how to create a watermark so typically a lot of times if you

23
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,880
have a and you're in a business you want to have the watermark on your page it shows that

24
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:20,720
hey this is my stuff that i created this stuff this is what it belongs to basically

25
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,080
okay and so that's what

26
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,160
this week is about it's about learning how to do a lot of that

27
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:37,200
formatting by using the tools of word rather than trying to manually format stuff okay so that's

28
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:46,880
this week is and so um read that read the text walk through it you won't

29
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:53,360
in you know when you read it you won't absorb it all um you have three practice things you can play

30
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,160
with if you want

31
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:59,200
yes and then you just have the one project assignment and it's always the same typical

32
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,720
you're going to download a file you're going to do all the changes to the file

33
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,360
and then you're going to upload that file it's going to get graded you can do that several times

34
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:15,360
um some people ask me and i've provided them information on their report their grade report

35
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,600
from cengage to say well here's what some gauge says you missed

36
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:19,760
i won't tell you all the things and how to fix them but i'll tell you more about them that way

37
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:19,860
um all the things and how to fix them but i'll tell you more about them later

38
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:19,920
okay um you're going to go to your 목p and then we'll talk about it first

39
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,740
i've been using double trending

40
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,760
and um i've been using acknowledge fiverr

41
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,000
for baked 달ard is it able to remediate individual files several times or multiple versions of your page

42
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,200
all the things and how to fix them but i'll tell you most of them like where it's telling me like

43
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:32,700
what step you did because there's a step of instructions like step 13 step 12 that kind of

44
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:40,480
stuff all right um so it's a quick one that's what we're doing this week and then i think next

45
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,980
week is our last week of word and then we'll move on to either powerpoint excel i'm still debating

00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:57,000
don't wait reach out as soon as possible all right thanks`;
