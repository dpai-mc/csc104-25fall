                Welcome to Week 6! This is our final week on Microsoft Word. We'll be covering how to create a resume using templates and various document sharing features. This week also introduces the final MS Word project, which is a separate assignment from the usual Cengage work. Please watch the introductory video below for a detailed overview. The transcript will highlight the text in sync with the video.

00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:10,240
Aloha and welcome. So we are week six into this semester and we're doing Word. This is our final

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:15,740
Word section. So it's module five from the textbook and it's about creating a resume

3
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:24,100
and sharing documents. And if we look at that section, you can see a lot of stuff about,

4
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:30,300
you know, different things you can do, how to create it from a template because there's

5
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,840
templates, resume templates. And so in this one, you'll use the resume template, but there's

6
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:43,800
other templates. There's templates for projects, for, you know, reports, for emails, for lots

7
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:49,740
of different things. Okay. And then it'll be how to change colors, how to do stuff with

8
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:53,260
fonts and themes and okay. 9
00:00:54,100 --> 00:01:02,500
So table rows, building blocks, auto-complete. There's lots of stuff in here. Again, like

10
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:08,400
I've said in the past, you go through it, understand what's available, what exists. 11
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:18,160
Make sure when you're doing your projects in Cengage, it matters how you do stuff. Okay. 12
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:24,080
If it says, you know, apply a style, typically what that means is they're a

13
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:24,100
style. If it says, you know, apply a style, typically what that means is they're a style. 14
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:30,980
So if you want to change the style of that type, name that style in Word. Okay. And you

15
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:36,140
create custom styles if you want, but there's existing styles in Word and then you can modify

16
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:42,480
them and apply them. So any text that is of that style, when you modify the style, they

17
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:48,800
all change automatically. Okay. So that means you don't have to copy and pick copy and then

18
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:54,080
or highlight and change what it looks like. You would just want to use the styles. Okay.

19
00:01:54,100 --> 00:02:05,780
Okay. Stuff like that. Sharing documents. I kind of have a little heartburn a little bit with this

20
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:12,060
one. Obviously PDFs are great, except for when you need to edit them or change them, then they're not

21
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:22,280
great. You can open a PDF in Word and it kind of opens funny and there's a bunch of extra formatting

22
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,100
stuff in there. 23
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:27,360
But then if you really wanted to use it in Word, you got to get rid of, it's kind of

24
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:34,820
a pain. But anyway, you can create PDF files in Word. You can grab a PDF file and as long

25
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:39,800
as it's a text-based file and not an image file, Word will attempt to open it and read

26
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:48,220
it and you'll have text that you can then play with. Okay. Different file types, same

27
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:54,080
to the OneDrive. How do you share it from your OneDrive? Remove a watermark. You can

28
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:03,040
send it using email. Okay. Hyperlinks. How to create web pages from Word. So if you can

29
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:09,360
give a Word document, you can just publish it as an HTML file or Word page. You can publish

30
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:15,180
it as an HTML file. It's a quick way if you're building a website or something. It's one

31
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:19,960
of the quickest ways where you can actually build something in Word, you know, kind of

32
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:23,900
format it, do bullets, whatever you want. Put in some images.

33
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:33,240
And then publish it as a web page and then put it up there. I personally hate it. That's

34
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:42,960
the word I hate. I hate doing it because it's kind of clunky from a web page side. Okay. 35
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:48,160
Every text is tagged with a certain format. And then if you want to change something,

36
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:54,060
it becomes a pain because it's not optimized, if you will. 37
00:03:54,080 --> 00:04:01,200
So for web, it looks okay. It looks good. It does what it says it does. But it's not

38
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:07,740
easy editable. The file you get isn't very easily editable unless you do it in Word again. 39
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:15,620
Okay. But anyway, that's all the Word stuff. And that'll finish us up for Word. And next

40
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:21,860
week, we're going to start Excel. Okay. But before we do that, I want to mention that

41
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:24,060
this week, you have Excel. 42
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:31,160
It shows two assignments this week. One is the standard Cengage. Do this assignment. 43
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,480
Submit it through Cengage. Hopefully, that's working for everybody. I know that I have

44
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:42,240
one or two people that are still having issues. But hopefully, we can work through them. And

45
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,920
then I have a MS Word project. And this is not turned in through Cengage. It's not done

46
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:53,060
through Cengage. You do this in Word and you submit your Word file.

47
00:04:54,080 --> 00:05:00,620
Okay. Now, the one thing, it's not due next week. It's due roughly two weeks, except for

48
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:07,020
instead of on a Monday, it's due on Sunday. So that's why it puts up here, one, no late

49
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:13,660
submissions. You have to turn it in by October 19th. Okay. And it's due on Sunday, not on

50
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:19,480
Monday. I made it worth 200 points. So it's worth two of the projects. So it's worth effectively

51
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,220
two weeks of work.

52
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:30,780
And when you look at the assignment, okay, it gives you a description. Here's what you're

53
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:39,720
doing. It tells you, you know, that's part one. Do this. You know, similar, but not the

54
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:44,660
same as the textbook, but similar. And I'm not, when I get done, I'm going to grade you

55
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:50,600
on, you know, I'll look through each file and I'll grade you on all these elements. 56
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:54,060
Okay. You don't have to create anything. There's a preparation. You don't have to create anything. 57
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,660
There's a proposal letter. So you're going to copy this information, dump it into word,

58
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:03,120
and then apply all this stuff to it, this formatting and whatever else it says to do. 59
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:09,940
Okay. And same, you're going to have some proposal content. So it's a mini proposal. 60
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:15,400
It's very short, but it's going to have like a cover page and a letter that goes with it. 61
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:22,400
And you're going to do it all in one file. Okay. So you can put this in there and then you're

62
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,860
going to do this, change the settings. 63
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,020
You're going to do this for the bulleted list, the information, and then you're going to have

64
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:32,720
a little table you got to put in. Here's some information for a table and do some stuff like

65
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:39,860
that. And then the last thing here is just how I'm going to grade it. Okay. It just deletes

66
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:45,220
everything basically that it says to do. It's going to be one for one, pretty much here. This

67
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:51,840
is where five is where 10. Okay. And then when you're done, you're going to save it as a doc X

68
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,060
file. It has to be a doc X file.

69
00:06:54,080 --> 00:07:01,440
Okay. It has to be done in word with a doc X extension. So I want your word file, your actual

70
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:09,140
word file. And so you upload it. If you do not upload a doc X file, it won't let you upload it. 71
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:15,120
So if you take your file and convert it to PDF, you can't upload the PDF. Okay. It needs to be a

72
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:23,760
doc X. Right. And so that's, I think it's going to be easier to do than the labs. 73
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:31,680
I mean, the actual projects in Cengage, but it's going through, it's not covering every single item

74
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,380
over the five modules. It's just picking and choosing a few of them. I didn't pick them all. 75
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:47,220
I picked 20 or 30% of them and I threw them in this file. Okay. And so hopefully that won't

76
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:51,700
cause anybody too much trouble and you'll be able to submit it. 77
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,160
I'm going to go ahead and add some things. 78
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,080
I'll just, I'll go ahead and add a little, a little bit of text.

79
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,080
Okay. And then I'm going to add the timeline.

80
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,760
Note this, do not add or generate your own content. 81
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,760
So the proposal itself is not a real full proposal. 82
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:10,500
It's just placeholder stuff and has some things in it that I want you to play with, but I'm not

83
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,500
doing things. 84
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:15,500
Some things like I have a long proposal, I'd have a lot of text and I'm going to have you put a

85
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:19,780
picture in, and then wrap the text around the picture and do some stuff like that. 86
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:20,600
I'm not doing that.

87
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,600
Be a little bit more basic than that. 88
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:30,580
all right so I just want to mention that this is in there if you have questions or

89
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:35,320
if I get a lot of questions maybe I'll set up a time when I'll be available

90
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:40,200
maybe next Monday or something but if they want something like that if you

91
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:49,020
want to have a time where you can try to join me as a group to talk about

92
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:53,460
anything in the class or this particular in particular do so if not

93
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:57,700
you can just schedule the people that have been having some issues with them

94
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,520
scheduling one-on-one meetings you can always schedule a one-on-one meeting on

95
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:05,180
my calendar okay and you can find that as part of the syllabus where my

96
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:13,440
calendar is right so that's all I wanted to say this week good luck and again

97
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,400
hopefully everything's working out for you and if it's not please reach out and

98
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,000
I've haven't responded yet

99
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,700
you've reached out and I haven't responded to you yet I'm sorry about

100
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:27,960
that but I will get back to you either tonight or tomorrow thanks`;
